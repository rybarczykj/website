                    <h2>Intro</h2>

                    <p>
                        Anyone who's used the python interactive interpreter will tell you the UI
                        sucks. It's truly a great tool for quickly typing python code, but if you're
                        not perfect —flawless syntax and indentation, incredible forethought,
                        ability to thrive in a boring black-and-white environment, and total
                        omniscience of all method names and arguments— your terminal will quickly
                        fill up with errors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enter bpython. A beautiful, wonderful, lightweight, free, open-source,
                        interface to the python interpreter here to save the day. If you ask me, all
                        python developers should use it. But don't take my word for it; I worked on
                        the project. Try it yourself!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Interactive Demo</h2>
                    <p>
                        The REPL below already has bpython installed. Just type
                        <code>bpython</code> to start it up. Note: browser performance is a little
                        slow and some features are buggy, but you should be able to get an idea of
                        the features.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>Things to try</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Play around a bit. You'll quickly notice syntax highlighting as you
                            type. Helpful!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make a mistake? Press control + R to undo your last input. (this feature
                            alone was enough to convince me).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Try defining a class or function. Auto indentation, syntax highlighting,
                            and undo should make it easy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Type <code> import math</code> (or some other library) and then
                            <code>math.</code> to see suggestions. Tab through them and type an open
                            paren to see the method signature!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Convinced? Go download it! Just type <code>pip install bpython</code> from
                        the command line and you're good to go. Then try these other features.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Press F7 to edit your bpython session in progress. Make some changes to
                            inputs, and when you close the file, the session will recompile with
                            your changes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't like vim as the default editor? Me neither. Open the config file
                            with F3, and go to line ~40 and follow the simple instructions to change
                            it to VSCode or Atom. There are some other useful configurations in that
                            file as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

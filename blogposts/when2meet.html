                        <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/"> www.when2meet.com</a> is a simple
                        web-based tool used to schedule meetings. A group leader sends out a link,
                        individuals fill out their availability, and the website displays the
                        most-available meeting times in the form of a multi-shaded green calendar,
                        where darker greens means more people are available, and lighter greens mean
                        fewer.

                        I thought it would be funny if I could make art on this website, similar to
                        how people make <a href="https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti">art</a> on
                        github contribution histories.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's how it works: Given an image and a when2meet link, the program
                        pixelizes the image, converts it to grayscale, determines the darkness of
                        each pixel, and sends a corresponding number of bots one-by-one to the link
                        to recreate the image. For the dark parts of the image, all or most bots are
                        'available', and for the light parts, few are.
                    </p>

                    <div class="imgContainer">
                        <img src="blogimages/homer.png" alt="homer" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        An interesting challenge was how pixel art translated to when2meet. One
                        square box on the schedule represents 1 hour on 1 day, but you can actually
                        specify down to <i>15-minute </i> increments. Essentially, I had 4 times the
                        vertical resolution as horizontal. To prepare images accordingly, I just had
                        to resize them to be 4 times as high as wide.

                        My original goal of minecraft creeper —a pretty basic pixel art image—
                        turned out to be so easy that I moved on to more complicated images, This
                        project was definitely a fun one, and due to how much I learned about
                        python, web scraping, and script writing, you can't say it was
                        <i>entirely</i> stupid and useless.

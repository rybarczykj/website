        <!-- <p> I love <b>python</b>, but I'll work in anything. I have experience in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS. </p>
        
        <p>I'm familiar with Git and AWS. I've coded remote and in-person, in pairs and solo. 
            I value making self-documentating code, and descriptive docstrings if not.

        <h2>My summer</h2> 

        <p> I spent my summer contracting remotely for <a href="https://www.quirk-econsulting.com">quirk e-consulting</a>, a team 
            sponsored and created by <a href="ballingt.com"> Thomas Balligner</a> to contribute to and improve upon existing open-source 
            projects. It was fun, and I learned a lot about software engineering in the real world. Here's what I worked on:     
        </p> 

            
            <h3>bpython</h3> 
        <p>
            bpython is a fancy interface to the python interpreter, with autocomplete, variable descriptors, syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, 
            and my personal favorite: UNDO. 
            Stay tuned to hear about some of my contributions.
            <!-- Read about some of what I did <a>here</a>. -->

        <h3>curtsies</h3> 
        <p> Curtsies, built to be the front-end of bpython, is a library with various
            terminal visual operations, like cursor
            moving, and colored strings. Here's a game I made to demonstrate:</p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h3> 
            <h3> when2meet art</h3>
            <p>This was a silly one. I made a script that allowed me to render images onto the calendar on popular group meeting site
                <a href="when2meet.com">when2meet.com</a>. I wrote a <a href="when2meet.html">blog post</a> about it.
            </p>

            <h3>personal website</h3>
            <p> I don't want to forget what I do, so I made this website to document my projects. It also makes a great portfolio. I built it from scratch with
                HTML and CSS, hosting it as a static s3 site on AWS.

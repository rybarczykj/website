                <h2>Software Consulting</h2> 
                <p> As part of a team created and sponsored by <a href="ballingt.com"> Thomas Ballinger</a>, 
                    I spent summer 2020 consulting for the following open source python libraries. (Blog post coming soon!)
                    <!-- It's been a great experience, teaching me lots about python, terminals, the world of open source, and software engineering in general.
                    I've been able to solve some interesting problems and accomplish some cool things. -->

                    bython is a fancy interface to the python interpreter used by thousands of programmers of all experience levels. I swear by it. 
                    Features include autocomplete, quick attribute inspection of objects, syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, the ability to edit your session in an
                    external editor, and my personal favorite: undo.

                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li> - Added much-requested support for fullwidth unicode characters, common in languages with non-Roman alphabets (and emojis!)</li>
                        <li> - Improved frontend for attribute completion to provide an intuitive distinction between methods and non-methods</li>
                        <li> - Fixed a 5 year old issue where long input lines were being wrongly treated as multiple lines in certain contexts </li>
                        <li> - Saved hundreds of lines of code in the codebase by implementing Python 3 exclusive methods, part of a greater effort to drop Python 2 support </li>
                        <li> - Made codebase more friendly to new contributors by adding gifs, documentation, and comments </li>

                <p> Curtsies, built to be the front-end of bpython, is a library with various
                    terminal visual operations, like cursor
                    movement, input detection, and colored strings. It allows for cool command line tools
                    which don't require lots of scrolling to show images. I expect to use curtsies a lot for my school
                    projects. Here's a game I made to demonstrate.</p>

                    <p> I don't want to forget what I do, so I made this website to document my projects. It also makes a great portfolio. I built it from scratch with
                        HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript, hosting it as a static s3 site on AWS through Cloudfront. Have you tried dark mode yet? Flip the switch in the top right.

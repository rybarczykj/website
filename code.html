                <h2>Software Consulting</h2> 
                <p> As part of a team created and sponsored by <a href="http://ballingt.com"> Thomas Ballinger</a>, 
                    I spent summer 2020 consulting for the some open source python libraries. (Blog post coming soon!)
                    <!-- It's been a great experience, teaching me lots about python, terminals, the world of open source, and software engineering in general.
                    I've been able to solve some interesting problems and accomplish some cool things. -->

                    bython is a fancy interface to the python interpreter used by thousands of programmers of all experience levels.
                    Features include autocompletion, auto suggesting, syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, the ability to edit your session in an
                    editor, and my personal favorite: undo.

                <p> Curtsies, built to be the front-end of bpython, is a library with various

                    movement, input detection, and colored strings. It allows for cool command line tools, like this game I made:</p>

                        For my software design class, I along with two partners created a Flask web app to visually display lyrical trends over the past 50 years.
                        Work included a backend in python, a database with PostgreSQL, a frontend in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The school won't host the site for us,
                        so I recently familiarized myself with AWS EC2 and Cloudfront to host it myself. Check it out:

                    </h3>
                    <p> I made this website to document my projects. I built it from scratch with
                        HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript, hosting it as a static s3 site on AWS. Have you tried dark mode yet? Flip the switch in the top right.

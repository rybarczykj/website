    <p><a href = "https://www.when2meet.com/"> www.when2meet.com</a> is a simple web-based tool used to schedule meetings. 
    A group leader sends out a link, individuals fill out their availability, and the website displays the most-available meeting times in the form of a multi-shaded green calendar,
     where darker greens means more people are available, and lighter greens mean fewer. 
    </p>
<p>
    The idea to make art on a when2meet has actually been with me for a while, before I even knew how to code. 
    I always thought it would be a funny if I had my improv troupe open up a when2meet to schedule a practice only to find a minecraft creeper face.
     The only thing stopping me, so I thought, was my artistic capacity. 
     It wasn’t until this weekend that I realized I totally had the means to pull this off, and got right to down to business.
</p>
<p>

    Here's how it works: Given an image and a when2meet link, the program pixelizes the image, converts it to grayscale, 
    determines the darkness of each pixel, and sends a corresponding number of bots one-by-one to the link to recreate the image. 
    For the dark parts of the image, all or most bots are 'available', and for the light parts, few are.
</p>

<p>
    An interesting challenge was how pixel art translated to when2meet. 
    One square box on the schedule represents 1 hour on 1 day, but availability can actually be specified down to 15-minute increments, 
    meaning that for every 1 hour box, there are 4 rectangular slab-shaped pixels, making for an odd (but better!) style of pixel art. 
    Essentially, I had 4 times the vertical resolution as horizontal. 
    All I had to do is, when preprocessing, resize images to be 4 times as high as wide. 
    They look tall and stretched out as references, but once rendered, they looked great.

</p>
<p>
    My original goal of minecraft creeper —a pretty basic pixel art image— turned out to be so easy that I moved on to more complicated images, 
    allowing for some pretty great reveals to my friends (not attached, but I'm talking full-on recognizable inside joke photos). 
    It definitely was a fun one, and due to how much I learned about python, web scraping, and script writing, you can't say it was <i>entirely</i> stupid and useless.

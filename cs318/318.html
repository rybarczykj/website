                        Love letters were actually one of the earliest forms of computational text
                        generation, found as far back as 1952, where Christopher Strachey and Alan
                        Turing made use of massive supercomputers which hours to produce a single
                        message.

                    <p>
                        For Assignment 2, we took advantage of our modern computers to create love
                        letters in a fraction of the time.

                        The grammars were loaded up with a vast vocabularily of the most lovey-dovey
                        words and sentence structures, making for some romantic messages!

                        <p>
                            For my midterm project, I made a T-Shirt generator. The grammar
                            generates some text, a description of an image, and a general style
                            idea, then I designed the shirt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The idea was to make shirts that look like real shirts, but feature
                            generally nonsensical text-- an idea loosely inspired by the comedic
                            mistranslations and gibberish sentences which occur with aestheticizing
                            the look of a different language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve a wide variety of this pseudo-english gibberish, I used
                            lyrics, specifically MF DOOM and Steely Dan, who I thought would make
                            for an interesting vocab. Crucially, I also ended up making a corpora
                            which combined consecutively uttered words as phrases, preserving that
                            sense of vague understandability.

                            Modeled after a certain brand of old-timey insults I feel like only
                            exist in movies, I made an insult generator.

                            My goal was for the generation to help me create new insults that didn't
                            really make sense, weren't actually offensive, but still sounded like
                            jabs.

                        As part of Assignment 3, my group built a game generator. With each
                        generation, the game creates series of tasks for you to complete as fast as
                        possible. We played this in class, and it was very fun.

                    <p>
                        In this particular example, the game draws from a large set of words,
                        animals, existing book titles, colors, and household objects, but the
                        generator had a lot of other possible tasks.

                            became aware of the silence, they heard a sound. It was faint, but
                            distinctly familiar. "Oh no". Intense memories came rushing back, and a
                            intense sense of panic. "It's a remote. My greatest fear". The sound was
                            louder now, undeniably a remote, and accompanied by a beating drum. "Oh
                            no", Jarvi said, looking for an escape, "it's here". It was louder
                            again, defeaning now; a ear-splitting roar. Jarvi covered their ears and
                            stumbled. <br /><br />The lights went out and the room was enveloped in
                            a dreadful silence and a sharp cold. Jarvi, horrified yet relieved,
                            turned around and screamed. they was face-to-face with a bloody remote.
                            "Oh no". The remote transformed into it in it's clown form, and Jarvi
                            was gone. 3The lights went out and the room was enveloped in a dreadful

                        was faint, but distinctly familiar. "Oh god". Dreadful memories came rushing
                        back, and a unbearable sense of dread."It's a hippogriff. My greatest fear".
                        The sound was louder now, undeniably a hippogriff, andaccompanied by a
                        screaming person. "Oh god", Valladao said, looking for an escape, "it's
                        here". It was louder again, defeaning now; a roaring roar. Valladao covered
                        his ears and gulped. <br /><br />
                        The lights went out and the room was enveloped in a unbearable silence and a
                        horrifying cold. Valladao, horrified yet relieved, turned around and
                        screamed. He was face-to-face with ademonic hippogriff. "Oh god". The
                        hippogriff transformed into it in it's clown form, and Valladao was gone.
                        <br /><br />
                        Wingeier moved to the locker room. Shappy moved to the map room.
                        <br /><br />Shappy was alone in map room. he felt a chill as the room
                        dropped 10 degrees. Just as Shappy became aware of the silence, he heard a
                        sound. It was faint, but distinctly familiar. "Aw sheesh". Terrible memories
                        came rushing back, and a terrible sense of horror. "It's a jailer. My
                        greatest fear". The sound was louder now, undeniably a jailer, and
                        accompanied by the screeching of a train. "Aw sheesh", Shappy said, looking
                        for an escape,"it's here". It was louder again, defeaning now; a
                        ear-splitting ruckus. Shappy covered his ears and gulped.<br /><br />
                        The lights went out and the room was enveloped in a horrifying silence and a
                        terrible cold. Shappy, horrified yet relieved, turned around and screamed.
                        he was face-to-face with a rottenjailer. "Aw sheesh". The jailer transformed
                        into it in it's clown form, and Shappy was gone.

                        You'll probably notice the robotic nature of things. That's because this
                        isn't just a generated text, but a generated series of events. Our new
                        techonology, called a Rule System, allowed me to create instances of
                        characters and have them preform tasks depending on where they are, and
                        other variables.

                            "Ok, Let's do this", she said, entering the door, "I hope it doesn't

                            yelled "hey! over here". The fight begun. <br /><br />
                            Wingeier, having got a good hit on the clown, freed Jarvi, who responded

                            Having scared nobody, it was powerless. The gang closed in on it, ending
